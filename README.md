# Papers & Technical Research

This repository contains my **research papers, technical notes, and exploratory work** focused on the reliability, evaluation, and governance of AI and Generative AI systems.

While my primary GitHub profile emphasizes **production-grade system building**, this repository is dedicated to the **research and reasoning** that informs those systems.

The goal here is clarity — separating **research exploration** from **production engineering**.

## Research focus areas

My work in this repository primarily explores:

- Responsible and governed Generative AI systems  
- Evaluation strategies for RAG and agentic architectures  
- Hallucination reduction and abstention mechanisms  
- Trade-offs between deterministic automation and agentic AI  
- Safety, PII controls, and auditability in real-world deployments  

These papers aim to bridge the gap between **theoretical ideas** and **practical system design**.
